# AES Security and Vulnerability: An Overview of Existing and Potential Attacks
### Purpose


### Scenario
- AES is an encrpytion algorithm used widely in order to protect user's information, financial trancsaction, medical profiles, ...
- As same as many encrypting algorithms, it's not impossuble to attack AES. 
- Understanding its vulnerabilities provides knowledges to develop more secure way to protect user's information.
### Goal
- Summary of AES's secuirty in protecting information nowadays.
- Clarify AES's vulnerabilites, including some weakness which can be easily exploited.
- Identify different attacks that has been spotted into AES recently, including existing  and some potential attacks in the future.
- Giving attack vectors, solution and testing some typical attack in AES.

### Configuration
- Khúc này thì config của máy tính thôi, cứ đưa đại như xài chip gì, hệ điều hành nào, bla bla
