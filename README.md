# An In-Depth Look at Advanced Attacks on Asymmetric Cryptography
### Purpose

- This project aim to provide to you a deep look into asymmetric cryptography : how does it works, its weaknesses and how we could protect our informations with it. This project will focus on 3 main asymmetric cipher : RSA, ECC  and lattice-based cryptography.

### Scenario
- AES is an encryption algorithm used widely in order to protect user's information, financial trancsaction, medical profiles, ...
- As same as many encrypting algorithms, it's not impossuble to attack AES. 
- Understanding its vulnerabilities provides knowledges to develop more secure way to protect user's information.
### Goal
- Summary of AES's security in protecting information nowadays.
- Clarify AES's vulnerabilites, including some weakness which can be easily exploited.
- Identify different attacks that has been spotted into AES recently, including existing  and some potential attacks in the future.
- Giving attack vectors, solution and testing some typical attack in AES.

### Configuration
- Khúc này thì config của máy tính thôi, cứ đưa đại như xài chip gì, hệ điều hành nào, bla bla
