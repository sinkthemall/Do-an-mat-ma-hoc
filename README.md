# An In-Depth Look at Advanced Attacks on Asymmetric Cryptosystem
### Purpose

- This project aim to provide to you a deep look into asymmetric cryptosystem : how does it works, its weaknesses and how dangerous it is when we don't implement it correctly . This project will focus on 3 main asymmetric cipher : RSA, ECC  and lattice-based cryptography.

### Scenario
- Asymmetric ciphers are used to transfer shared-key (reason for this is because most of asymmetric ciphers are time-consuming as it costs a lot to compute and transfer ciphertext)
- Asymmetric ciphers are also the core of DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), it is used to sign, protect the interity of contracts.
- Weak implementation or misuse could lead to secret key reveal, or decryption of ciphertext without secret key, even forged signature on fake contracts.

### Goal


### Configuration
- Operating system : Window 11 Home single Language 64 bit
- Processor: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H 2.30 GHz(16 CPUs)
- Memory : 8Gb
- GPU : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU
