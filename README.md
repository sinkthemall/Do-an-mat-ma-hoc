# An In-Depth Look at Advanced Attacks on Asymmetric Cryptography
### Purpose

- This project aim to provide to you a deep look into asymmetric cryptography : how does it works, its weaknesses and how dangerous it is whem we implement encryption poorly or incorrectly. This project will focus on 3 main asymmetric cipher : RSA, ECC  and lattice-based cryptography.

### Scenario
- Asymmetric ciphers are used to transfer shared-key (reason for this is because most of asymmetric ciphers are time-consuming as it costs a lot to compute and transfer ciphertext)
- Asymmetric ciphers are also the core of DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), it is used to sign, protect the interity of contracts.
- Weak implementation or misuse could lead to secret key reveal, or decryption of ciphertext without secret key, even forged signature on fake contracts.

### Goal
- An overview of the current state of security provided by asymmetric cryptography in protecting information.
- Deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities of asymmetric cryptography and how attackers can exploit them.
- Developing some demos how an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in asymmetric cryptography.
- Providing the most common methods for attacking asymmetric cryptography
- Promoting awareness and understanding of the importance of secure encryption practices
